This part of documentation literally renders documents under
``tools/memory-model/`` and ``tools/memory-model/Documentation/``.

.. note::
   Please refrain from adding reST markers in these documents.
   It is the consensus of LKMM maintainers that they are kept in
   *pure* plain text forms for the benefit of developers who prefer
   nice dumb terminals in viewing/editing them.
